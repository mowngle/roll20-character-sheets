# Open Legend Minimalist
Developed by Déja Augustine (a.k.a. [Kertész](https://app.roll20.net/users/1068768/kertesz) and [@dejaaugustine](https://twitter.com/dejaaugustine))

This character sheet is intended for use with the [Open Legend](http://www.openlegendrpg.com) system. In keeping with the spirit of Open Legend, the sheet does not enforce any rules (that's for your GM to do or not do at their discretion).

## Known Issues
* Physical dice prompts for attributes with a zero score show an extraneous "+" in them
* Advantage 7+ and Disadvantage 7+ are not supported
* Hitpoints, Legend Points, Speed, and Wealth are not formatted correctly on iPad

## Key Features
* Advantage / Disadvantage is tracked separately for each attribute or action, and the interface appears any time you hover over a roll button.
* When rolling to invoke a boon, the roll template will display the range of power levels that your roll would enable you to invoke.
* Players can switch between using Roll20's built-in dice engine or prompts to enter the total rolled on physical dice. Both options are equally compatible with all features and templates.
